%%Description
% This function utilizes Bayesâ€™ rule to reverse the arcs between vector
% nodes. This function assumes a Gaussian influence diagram with four
% vector nodes x0, x1, x2, and x3. It is assumed that x0 has n0 elements;
% x1 has n1 elements, x2 has n2 elements, and x3 has n3 elements. Also, it
% is assumed that x0 is a predecessor to x1, x2, and x3 in the influence
% diagram, that x1 is a predecessor to x2 and x3 in the influence diagram.
% , and that x2 is a predecessor to x3 in the influence diagram. It
% reverses vector node x1 into vector node x2.
